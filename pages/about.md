**Pursuing a passion for Learning, Innovation, and Excellence

My name is Tyler Aaron Land, and I am a junior undergraduate pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Irvine.

I currently reside in Orange County and work with Spongellé as a Junior Design Engineer. Previously, I completed a design engineering internship at RBC Bearings, where I gained valuable hands-on experience in mechanical systems and testing.

I have experience in SolidWorks CAD, including 3D modeling, technical drawings, and design for manufacturing. My background also includes manufacturing techniques, GD&T tolerancing, and rapid prototyping, allowing me to bring concepts from initial design through early-stage production.

Through my coursework and professional roles, I have developed a solid foundation in teamwork, communication, and collaborative problem-solving across a wide range of engineering projects. My goal as a future engineer is to push my potential to its fullest by continuously expanding my knowledge and practical skills.
